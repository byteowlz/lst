# AGENTS.md - Development Guide for lst

This file provides guidance to humans and AI Agents when working with code in this repository.

## Project: lst - personal lists & notes App

## Issue Tracking (trx)

```bash
trx ready              # Show unblocked issues
trx create "Title" -t task -p 2   # Create issue (types: bug/feature/task/epic/chore, priority: 0-4)
trx update <id> --status in_progress
trx close <id> -r "Done"
trx sync               # Commit .trx/ changes
```

Priorities: 0=critical, 1=high, 2=medium, 3=low, 4=backlog

## Code Style

- **Rust**: Use `anyhow::Result` for errors, `thiserror` for custom errors, snake_case naming
- **TypeScript**: Double quotes, semicolons required, React functional components with hooks
- **Imports**: Group by external/internal, use workspace dependencies in Cargo.toml
- **Error Handling**: Rust uses `?` operator, TypeScript uses try/catch with proper error types
- **Naming**: Rust snake_case, TypeScript camelCase, components PascalCase

### Architecture

- **Paradigm**: Everything is text/files, markdown as source of truth (except mobile SQLite)
- **Sync**: CRDT-based encrypted sync to server for multi-device support
- **Structure**: Workspace with CLI, server, desktop/mobile Tauri apps, protocol crates
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Radix UI + CodeMirror for editing
- **Theming**: Comprehensive base16/base24 theme system across all applications

### Testing

- Run `cargo check` after Rust changes to validate compilation
- Use `bun run lint` in app directories to check TypeScript style
- Test individual Rust modules with `cargo test <module_name>`

#### End-to-End Type Safety with Tauri Specta

This project uses Tauri Specta for automatic TypeScript generation from Rust types, ensuring type safety between the Rust backend and TypeScript frontend.

##### Requirements for Specta Integration

1. **Dependencies**: All crates that expose types to the frontend must include:

   ```toml
   specta = { version = "2.0.0-rc.22", features = ["uuid", "chrono"] }
   ```

2. **Type Derivation**: All structs/enums exposed to TypeScript must derive `specta::Type`:

   ```rust
   use specta::Type;

   #[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Type)]
   pub struct MyStruct {
       // fields
   }
   ```

3. **Command Functions**: Tauri commands must use `#[specta::specta]` annotation:

   ```rust
   #[tauri::command]
   #[specta::specta]
   fn my_command() -> Result<MyStruct, String> {
       // implementation
   }
   ```

4. **Supported Types**: Use types with Specta support:
   - Built-in types: `String`, `i32`, `bool`, `Vec<T>`, `Option<T>`, etc.
   - External types require feature flags: `Uuid` (uuid feature), `DateTime<Utc>` (chrono feature)
   - Custom types must derive `Type`

5. **Code Generation**: TypeScript bindings are automatically generated to `src/bindings.ts` during development builds, providing full type safety for frontend API calls.

### Theme System

The project includes a comprehensive theming system with the following components:

#### Core Theme System (`lst-core/src/theme.rs`)

- **Base16/Base24 support**: Standard color specifications for consistent theming
- **Built-in themes**: Catppuccin, Gruvbox, Nord, Solarized, and more
- **Theme inheritance**: Support for theme variants and overrides
- **CSS generation**: Automatic CSS custom properties generation

#### CLI Theme Commands

```bash
lst theme list          # List available themes
lst theme apply <name>  # Apply a theme
lst theme current       # Show current theme
lst theme info <name>   # Get theme details
lst theme validate <file> # Validate theme file
```

#### CLI User Management Commands (requires lst-server)

```bash
lst user list                    # List all users
lst user create <email>          # Create a new user
lst user delete <email>          # Delete a user (with confirmation)
lst user delete <email> --force  # Delete a user without confirmation
lst user update <email> --name <name> --enabled <true/false>  # Update user info
lst user info <email>            # Show detailed user information
```

#### Frontend Integration

- **Desktop**: Theme selector in sidebar with live switching
- **Mobile**: Theme selector in Settings panel with bottom sheet UI
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Dynamic color injection without restart
- **React Hooks**: `useTheme` hook for theme state management

#### Implementation Notes

- Theme commands must be registered in both `collect_commands!` and `invoke_handler!` macros
- Theme data types must derive `specta::Type` for TypeScript generation
- CSS variables are injected at runtime via `applyThemeToDOM` function
- Hardcoded colors should be replaced with CSS custom properties
